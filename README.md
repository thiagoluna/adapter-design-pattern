## üöÄ Technology

- [PHP 8.3](https://php.net)

## üìë Project

This project is an example of a practical application of the Adapter Design Pattern.  
In the implemented example, we have the case of being able to use the DomPdf or TCPdf lib to generate reports.  
Without the Adapter, every time we have to change between one lib or another, we will need to change the `generate()` method.  
However, with the adapter, we simply instantiate the class referring to the lib we want to use and pass it as a class parameter
which calls `generate()`.
